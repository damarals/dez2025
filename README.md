# Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025 - Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025 cohort. The course covers essential tools and technologies used in modern data engineering.

### Development Setup

Almost all modules follow a standardized development setup using:
- **VS Code with Dev Containers**: Ensuring consistent development environments
- **Poetry**: Python dependency management
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Service containerization
