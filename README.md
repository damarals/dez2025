# Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025 - Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2025 cohort. The course covers essential tools and technologies used in modern data engineering.

### Development Setup

All modules follow a standardized development setup using:
- **VS Code with Dev Containers**: Ensuring consistent development environments
- **Poetry**: Python dependency management
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Service containerization

It's highly recommended to use VS Code with the Dev Containers extension for the best development experience.

## Module 1: Docker & SQL

### Project Structure

```
.
├── .devcontainer/         # VS Code Dev Container configuration
├── .docker/               # Docker-related scripts
├── notebooks/             # Jupyter notebooks with solutions
├── scripts/               # Python scripts for data ingestion
├── terraform/             # Infrastructure as Code files
├── docker-compose.yaml    # Services configuration
├── Dockerfile             # Container image definition
└── pyproject.toml         # Python project dependencies
```

### Environment Components

- **PostgreSQL**: Main database for storing taxi trip data
- **pgAdmin**: Web interface for database management
- **Python Environment**: Using Poetry for dependency management

### Technologies Used

- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization and service orchestration
- **PostgreSQL**: Data storage and querying
- **Python**: Data processing and ingestion
- **Poetry**: Dependency management
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Cloud infrastructure

## Module 2: Workflow Orchestration
